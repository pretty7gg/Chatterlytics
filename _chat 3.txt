You are informed that a Hawan ceremony is being organized at the hostel on Sunday at 10 am. You are all requested to be present.

Thank you.
[31/08/24, 12:40:29 PM] ~ khushi: what's the issue with the ACs?? it seems like every other day the chillers are switched off because of some technical issue. why is it that the ac is out of order in some room every week? why was all this maintenance not done in the 2 month break when all the rooms were empty? kindly deal with this on priority. it is very uncomfortable for the 600 residents to deal with this issue every day.
[31/08/24, 12:41:16 PM] ~ Arshiya Kishore: How much more time will it take?
Everyday there is some or the other room. Is this what we are paying for?

[31/08/24, 12:42:52 PM] ~ Arshiya Kishore: And if these matters are being taken to higher authorities we get a long message to wait for 48 hours. Its been more than a month. Please look into this with UTMOST PRIORITY.
[31/08/24, 12:43:08 PM] ~ Sukh Maan: It will take half an hour...
Sorry for inconvenience.
[31/08/24, 12:43:55 PM] ~ Amee Mishra: Everyday it is the same story
[31/08/24, 12:45:32 PM] ~ Anshi💕: Yes. It is understandable once or twice, but there have been issues literally every single day. Why is this not being resolved? And why are such things not taken care of in the break? We have our exams our interviews we need to prepare for. Basic needs like air conditioning and water are not being provided properly. This is very poor on the part of hostel management. This is not what pay our hostel fee for. 


Kindly look into it on priority. We have been quite patient. The patience we have isn't unlimited. ‎<This message was edited>

[06/09/24, 10:52:08 AM] ~ ananya: @919855900173 ma'am this ac issue has become really exhausting, we have given fees so that we don't face all these issues and they haven't been resolved since the past month it cannot keep going on like this. the ac chillers have been off since 6:30 in the morning are we not supposed to sleep also, we are trying to cooperate but this is too much now

[06/09/24, 10:55:11 AM] ~ Arshiya Kishore: The reason we will get is "Students use high voltage appliances" 🤡

[06/09/24, 11:02:21 AM] ~ ‎Jasrehmat: the other day when we asked for the fee breakdown under your message regarding the drying racks also the authority replied so vaguely as if you just put it in chat gpt or something, you need to do something about it you didn’t even answer our question it’s not that hard to just provide with the fee breakdown???????????

[06/09/24, 7:44:44 PM] ~ Aarushi Juneja: What’s going on with this issue that hasn’t been fixed since morning? How can the management be so poor?  Do you even realize the kind of rooms we’ve been given? There’s no ventilation, and we really need AC. Patience and cooperation are fine, but this is getting too much. If we get the service we paid for even for one day, it would be a miracle. The Wi-Fi doesn’t work properly all day, and the AC situation is no better.

[06/09/24, 9:10:43 PM] ~ Varada: @918847448020 @919855900173 
More than 10 hours and there is no chilling in the AC. The warden should take up this issue, cause we’re paying heavy amounts for these facilities. 
Every second day we’re facing the same issue. 
Immediate action should be taken else we would need to contact higher authorities.
